### Implementation Details

This app uses Vite, React, SWC, Typescript, TailwindCSS and Express (for the tiny mock server)

App.tsx fetches the medals.json through the Express server (located in the /mock folder).

The data is then passed into the MedalsPage, and subsequently into the MedalTable. The MedalTable is a concrete implementation of its child MultiSortTable, which takes some props including sortPriorities which informs it on how to deal with tie-breakers. Note that only a single tie-breaker was specified in the requirements for each field, but you could pass in additional sort priorities, for instance:

```code
  {
     total: ["gold"],
     gold: ["silver"],
     silver: ["gold"],
     bronze: ["gold, silver"],
  }
```

One known bug is that the blank header for country names is clickable/sortable.

I did also want to implement a version using Next.js, but ran out of time unfortunately.
